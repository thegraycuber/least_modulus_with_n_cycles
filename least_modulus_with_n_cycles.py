This program is used to calculate the smallest integers k such that (Z/kZ)* can be represented as the direct product of n cyclic groups, for different values of n

For example, the 4th term is 56 because (Z/56Z)* â‰… C2 x C2 x C2 x C3 and there is no integer smaller than 56 with a representation as the product of 4 cyclic groups

(Z/kZ)* denotes the multiplicative group of integers modulo k
